DistCp (distributed copy) is a tool used for large inter/intra-cluster copying. 
It uses Map/Reduce to effect its distribution, error handling and recovery, 
and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories into input to map tasks, 
each of which will copy a partition of the files specified in the source list.

Enable feature that DistCp can then copy files from insecure hdfs cluster to secure
one that requires Kerberos authentication.
Command line:
1. Use -copyFromInsecureToSecure to enable this new feature.
2. Use -targetprinc to specify Kerberos principal name.
3. Use -targetkeytab to specify the keytab file name so mapper task can find it in cache.
4. Use generic option -files to specify config files of target secure cluster, and
hadoop will copy and distribute these files to all nodes that DistCp mapper task will
run. Config file names are core-site-target.xml, hdfs-site-target.xml by convention.
You should also attach keytab for mapper task to do Kerberos authentication before
accessing target file system.

For example,
hadoop jar chocolate-distcp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -files core-site-target.xml,hdfs-site-target.xml,b_marketing_tracking_APD.keytab -copyFromInsecureToSecure -targetprinc b_marketing_tracking@APD.EBAY.COM -targetkeytab b_marketing_tracking_APD.keytab hdfs://elvisha/demo hdfs://apollo-phx-nn-ha/user/b_marketing_tracking/Test
* Since main class has been set in the manifest during maven build, we must ignore it
from command line, otherwise command options won't be parsed properly.
